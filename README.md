# Weather-app

## Mission objective

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission...

Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME...

Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

## Specifications

* In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
* On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
* The application must be responsive and mobile friendly
